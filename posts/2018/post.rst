I'll get my kit! That's not soon enough! Anyone who laughs is a communist! I'm a thing.

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! _Yes._ *You gave me a dollar and some candy.* You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Why would I want to know that?
--------------------------------

Say what? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

1. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
2. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
3. She also liked to shut up!

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

Shut up and get to the point! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidatesâ€¦ PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

* And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
* I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
* Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Shinier than yours, meatbag.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I just told you! You've killed me! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Meh.

I'm a thing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Ask her how her day was. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

You know, I was God once. It must be wonderful. And then the battle's not so bad? Daylight and everything. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

With gusto. I had more, but you go ahead. Leela's gonna kill me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

I wish! It's a nickel. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Take me to your leader! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
