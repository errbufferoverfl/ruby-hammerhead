        A template repo for setting up your own Sphinx/ablog website using the Pydata Sphinx Theme.

        This repo was made so people could easily get started using Sphinx and ablog to hot their own website, on GitHub pages,
        Azure Storage, or a static hosting service of their choice. This repo is part of a series of blog posts I wrote on how
        to build your website and publish it using Azure DevOps and Azure Storage.
