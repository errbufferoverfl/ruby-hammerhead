Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Now what? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Tell them I hate them. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? __Ummm…to eBay?__ *No!* The cat shelter's on to me.

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Large bet on myself in round one. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

1. But I've never been to the moon!
2. You're going to do his laundry?
3. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!

Moving along…

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

* Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
* OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
* Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Look, last night was a mistake. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Why did you bring us here? No, I'm Santa Claus! Say what?

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Daylight and everything. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

What are their names? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. They're like sex, except I'm having them!

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Tell them I hate them. Soon enough. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. No. We're on the top. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Oh yeah, good luck with that.
